## Financial Considerations

### Revenue Expectations

- Target with Veyya: ฿60,000-90,000
- Willing to pay commission: 15-20% if value is clear
- Expects: 2x payment speed vs cash collection

### Value Calculation
- **Time saved**: 10-15 hours/month on admin = ฿5,000-7,000 value
- **New customers**: 5-10 new clients/month = ฿10,000-20,000
- **No-show reduction**: 80% fewer no-shows = ฿5,000 saved
- **Total value**: ฿20,000-27,000/month → justifies 20% commission

---

## Key Insights

1. **Time is money** - Every hour on admin is hour not earning
2. **Quality over quantity** - Prefers fewer good clients over many difficult ones
3. **Trust through results** - Will commit if she sees growth in first 3 months
4. **Community matters** - Wants to connect with other providers
5. **Professional pride** - Values being treated as skilled professional, not gig worker
