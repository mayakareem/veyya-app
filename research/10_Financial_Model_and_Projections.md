\
## Overview\
This financial model outlines Veyya\'92s revenue structure, unit economics, operating expenses, and profitability targets for the first 24 months.  \
The projections are built on conservative assumptions derived from comparable platforms (UrbanClap, JustLife, Ruuby) and localized for Thailand\'92s cost base and market dynamics.\

|------------|--------|-------------|\
| Average Booking Value (ABV) | $50 | Weighted average across beauty, cleaning, pet services |\
| Platform Commission | 30% | Split: 70% freelancer / 30% Veyya |\
| Monthly Active Customers (Month 6 target) | 1,000 | Steady-state base post-POC |\
| Repeat Rate | 60% | Expected based on convenience and satisfaction |\
| Freelancer Retention | 80% | Due to consistent bookings and fair pay |\
| Average Jobs per Freelancer | 15 / month | Each performs 3\'964 services per week |\

\

\
## 2. Revenue Model\
\
### 2.1 Base Formula\
**Gross Revenue (GMV)** = Total Bookings \'d7 Average Booking Value  \
**Platform Revenue** = GMV \'d7 Commission Rate (30%)\
\
### 2.2 Example\
- 1,000 customers \'d7 2 bookings/month \'d7 $50 = $100,000 GMV  \
- Platform share (30%) = $30,000 / month  \
\
**Annualized Revenue (Year 1 target):** $360,000  \
**Projected Year 2 (3x growth):** $1.08M  \
