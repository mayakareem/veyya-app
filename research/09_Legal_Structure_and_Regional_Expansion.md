\
## Overview\
Veyya\'92s legal and operational structure is designed around a **Singapore-based holding company (HoldCo)** that owns the intellectual property (IP), brand, and technology stack.  \
This structure enables efficient expansion into Asian markets through local partnerships, ensuring compliance with foreign ownership laws, optimized taxation, and regional scalability.\
