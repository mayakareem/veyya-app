# Design Specification (UX/UI)

## Principles
- Premium look (soft pastels, generous whitespace), fast interactions, accessible contrast.
- Minimal steps: discovery→provider→slot→pay→done.

## Screen Map (Client)
- Home (categories, search)
- Service Detail (price, duration, rating, photos)
- Provider List & Profile
- Slot Picker (calendar/time)
- Checkout (address, notes, payment)
- Booking Status
- Reviews
- Account (profile, payments, addresses)

## Screen Map (Provider)
- Dashboard (requests, today)
- Availability (manual/calendar connect)
- Booking Details (accept/reject)
- Wallet & Payouts
- Profile & Documents

## Admin (Web)
- Providers (queue, KYC detail)
- Bookings (filters)
- Finance (payout batches, exports)
- Analytics (GMV, cancellations, CSAT)
- Disputes
