# Product & Engineering Process

## Discovery → Design → Build → Launch
- Discovery: personas, problem framing, competitor teardown
- Design: flows, wireframes, content style, accessibility checklist
- Build: trunk‑based dev, CI/CD, feature flags
- QA: test cases, E2E flows, non‑functional tests
- Launch: pilot cohort, observability (logs/metrics/traces)

## Governance
- Weekly product review
- Biweekly backlog grooming
- Monthly analytics review & roadmap update
